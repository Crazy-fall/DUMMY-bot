# Discord_Bot_ Self_Kick

*well its was a fun project*
for new devs who dont want your bot in certain server : 

NOW YOU CAN MAKE YOUR BOT KICK HIMSEF out from the server 

code itself is simple but if you are a brain dead like me (watch below)


# Put_TOKEN-IN : BOT_TOKEN

you need admin perms to use : list_guilds command (everything  gonna show up in terminal  but anyways)

you need to be BOT Owener  to use : leave_guild command

and this is it # go Duck yourself
